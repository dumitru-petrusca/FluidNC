The hydraulic cylinder pushes down on the fork end of the draw bar.
This pushes down on the top of the spring stack. The bottom of the
spring stack sits on the top of the collet sleeve. The bottom of the
collet sleeve sits up against a shoulder inside the spindle. So yes,
the spindle bearings do see the full force of the hydraulic cylinder
during unclamping. In this scenario it is the top two spindle bearings
that see the force of the unclamping. The bottom two (nearest the tool
taper) are unaffected.

As for the clamping force I am not sure. I would imagine it is the
standard cat40 clamping force. According to
(https://tacrockford.com/product/gauges/force-check/technical/typical-power-drawbar-clamping-forces/)
the suggested drawbar pull force for a cat40 should be 2300lbs
